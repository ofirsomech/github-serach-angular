# GitHub Repository Search App

This is a simple Angular application that allows you to search for GitHub repositories and bookmark your favorite ones.
To use the app, you'll need to login with the username "root" and the password "123456".

# Usage

To search for GitHub repositories, enter a search term in the input field and press the "Search" button or press enter. The app will display up to 30 search results. To see more information about a repository, click on its name or image.

To bookmark a repository, click on the "Bookmark" button. Bookmarked repositories will appear in the Bookmarks section of the app.

To remove a bookmark, click on the "Bookmarked" button in the Bookmarks section.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
